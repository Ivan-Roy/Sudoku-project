****************************VIRTUAL SUDOKU*******************************

>About the Game: This is a logic based,combinatorial number placemnet puzzle.The objective of the game is to
		 fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column,row and sub-grid compose of all the digits
		 from 1-9 (repeatation of digits is not allowed).


>How To Play: 1.Run the program named sudoku.c,
	      2.Copy one of the test cases from the testcase.txt file and paste it on the output terminal of
		the program and hit enter,
              3.Now, as per your choice select numbers from 1-9 as there are 9 sub-grids in a 9x9 table
	      4.Fill up the sub-grids,
	      5.To check whether the sub-grids have been completely filled or not,enter digits from 1-9,
		the program will show how many empty boxes are left in each sub-grid,
              6.Now,as all the sub-grids would have been filled,press 0 to stop filling the boxes
              7.Hit Enter,
              8.If you filled the sub-grids correctly,the program will display,"Solved Successfully!!",
		otherwise,"Try Again!!".
